          Venture into a dark dimension full of caves! Emeralds will spawn more
          than usual here. Terrain above Y=130 won't have caves but may have
          giant caverns. Lava in this dimension will also spread much quicker
          than in The Overworld!

          You cannot sleep in The Deep Dark. Respawn Anchors also will not work
          here.
